# java_fundamentals_1_marek_tomecek
This Project seeks to utilize the concepts learnt in Java_Fundamentals 1 and answer several questions posed during the session.

1. Project Description
The project consists of four sections, three java code packages and one .docx document. Each of these answers one of the assignment questions that have been given:

    1.Describe the JVM architecture in detail.

    2.Why are float and double excluding characters after a specified number of places? What is the difference between float and double?

    3.Explain use of super keyword with examples. (super.variable,super.method,super(values)).

    4.Is Java Call by Value or Call by reference? Explain with an example.

The three code packages can be found in the attached src directory. The .docx is available in the same directory as the readme.

2. How to Install and Run the Project
    This project should be imported into your prefferred Java IDE via creating a standard project utilizing jdk 17. Importing the src imports all of the work created during this assignment.

3. How to Use the Project
    Each package contains relevant classes and a main class where the runtime for these classes occurs. I have placed comments for clarity where I felt they were needed.

4. References
